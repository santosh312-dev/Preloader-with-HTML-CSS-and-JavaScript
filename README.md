This project demonstrates a simple yet effective preloader (loading screen) implementation using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The purpose of a preloader is to display a loading animation or image (such as a GIF or spinner) while the web page’s resources are being fetched and rendered. Once the page has completely loaded, the preloader fades out smoothly, revealing the actual content.

The implementation is straightforward. An HTML <div> element acts as the preloader container, which spans the full width and height of the viewport. Inside it, you can place any loading animation—commonly a GIF image, an SVG animation, or a CSS spinner. CSS styling ensures that the preloader is fixed, centered, and layered on top of all other content with a high z-index.

A small JavaScript snippet listens for the window.load event, which is triggered when the page and all its assets (images, stylesheets, scripts, etc.) have been fully loaded. At this point, the script applies a fade-out class to the preloader. With a smooth CSS transition, the preloader fades away, and the main content is revealed by toggling its display property. This creates a polished user experience, preventing abrupt content flashes and giving a professional feel to the webpage.

The project is minimal and customizable. Developers can easily replace the sample loading GIF with their own animation or switch to a CSS-based loader. The fade duration, background color, and design can all be adjusted according to the needs of the project.

This preloader setup is particularly useful for websites with heavy content, large images, or slow-loading resources. It ensures users remain engaged with a visual cue while the page finishes loading, thereby improving both usability and aesthetics.
